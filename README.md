🕹️ Push Survivors

A Web3 survival shooter on Push Chain where players upload, mint, and upgrade their own NFT weapons to fight, earn, and trade.

🚀 Overview

Push Survivors is a blockchain-powered roguelike survival game built on Push Chain.
Players upload their custom gun designs, mint them as NFTs, and use them in fast-paced gameplay to fight waves of enemies.

As you survive longer, you earn in-game coins — which can be converted into on-chain tokens after each round. These tokens can then be used to upgrade weapons, buy on-chain utilities, or trade items with other players.

The game merges skill-based progression with true asset ownership, creating a fun, replayable, and decentralized gaming economy.

🎯 Problem It Solves

Most Web3 games make NFTs purely collectible — static assets with no real use or progression.
Push Survivors changes that by making NFTs functional, upgradeable, and interactive, rewarding real gameplay skill and giving players true ownership and utility over their in-game items.
